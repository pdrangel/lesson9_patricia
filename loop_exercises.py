# Exercise 1:
# Write a for loop so that every item in the list is printed
animals = ["koala", "cat", "fox", "panda", "chipmunk", "sloth", "penguin", "dolphin"]

# --- WRITE YOUR CODE BELOW ---







# Exercise 2:
# Write a for loop which prints "Hello!, " plus each name in the list. i.e.: "Hello!, Sam"
names = ["Sam", "Lisa", "Micha", "Dave", "Wyatt", "Emma", "Sage"]

# --- WRITE YOUR CODE BELOW ---







# Exercise 3:
# Write a for loop which appends the square of each number to a new list (you have to create this new list).
numbers = [3, 7, 6, 8, 9, 11, 15, 25]

# --- WRITE YOUR CODE BELOW ---







# Exercise 4:
# Write a for loop using an if statement, that appends each number to a new list if it's positive.
all_numbers = [111, 32, -9, -45, -17, 9, 85, -10]

# --- WRITE YOUR CODE BELOW ---









# Exercise 5:
# Calculate the sum of all numbers from 1 to a given number 
# The number given should be given by the user - hint: use input()

# --- WRITE YOUR CODE BELOW ---











# Exercise 6: 
# Write a program to print multiplication table of a given number
# (again via user input)

# for example num = 2
# the output should be:
# 2
# 4
# 6
# 8
# 10
# 12
# 14
# 16
# 18
# 20

# --- WRITE YOUR CODE BELOW ---







# Exercise 7: Count the total number of digits in a number
# Write a program to count the total number of digits in a number using a loop.

# For example, the number is 75869, so the output should be 5.

# --- WRITE YOUR CODE BELOW ---














# Exercise 8: Print list in reverse order using a loop
# Print the items of the given list in reverse
reverse_this_list = [10, 20, 30, 40, 50]

# --- WRITE YOUR CODE BELOW ---
















# Exercise 9: Find the factorial of a given number

# Write a program to use the loop to find the factorial of a given number. The number should be given by user input.
# The factorial (symbol: !) means to multiply all whole numbers from the chosen number down to 1.
# For example: calculate the factorial of 5: 
# 5! = 5 × 4 × 3 × 2 × 1 = 120
# Expected output for 5: 120

# --- WRITE YOUR CODE BELOW ---

















# Exercise 10: Reverse a given integer number. The number should be given by user input
# Example: 76542 should output 24567
